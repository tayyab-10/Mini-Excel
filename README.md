Project Description

Welcome to the Mini Excel project! This is a simplified spreadsheet application implemented in C++ as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. The project demonstrates the practical application of fundamental DSA concepts in building a functional mini Excel-like software.

Features

Grid-based interface: A user-friendly interface resembling a typical spreadsheet grid.
Cell Operations: Basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed within cells.
Data Storage: Efficient storage and retrieval of data using appropriate data structures.
Dynamic Updates: Automatic updates of dependent cells when a cell value changes.
File Operations: Save and load spreadsheets from a file.
Technical Highlights
Data Structures: Utilizes arrays, linked lists, and hash maps for efficient data management.
Algorithms: Implements sorting and searching algorithms for enhanced functionality.
OOP Principles: Applies Object-Oriented Programming principles for modular and maintainable code.
Error Handling: Robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and operations.
This project serves as an educational tool to understand the integration of data structures and algorithms in real-world applications. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or fork the repository to build upon it!
